# MINST-VAE

Variational Auto Enconder (VAE) implementation using ELBO loss with both Tensroflow and PyTorch frameworks on MNIST dataset.

## `Mnist_VAE_PyTorch_NN.ipynb`:

A simple VAE implemented in PyTorch and trained on MNIST dataset. Both the encoder and decoder use a fully connected neural network with only one hidden layer.

## `Mnist_VAE_TensorFlow_NN.ipynb`:

Same network implemented using Tensorflow.

## `Mnist_VAE_TensorFlow_CNN.ipynb`:

The encoder is replaced with a convolutional neural network (C64-C128-C512). The decoder is the same is before.
